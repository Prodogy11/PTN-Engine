# PTN Engine 
The *PTN Engine* is a C++ (C++ 11) library that implements the rules of Petri 
nets. Its purpose is to be integrated in other programs and to enable the 
integrating program to have its logic defined by a Petri net.

For more information read the documentation in the Doc directory. There is also 
a user guide that will help you getting started fast. Additionaly examples of 
the *PTN Engine* usage are available in the the Examples directory.

*PTN Engine* can be built with GCC 4.9 and Visual C++ 2015 and CMake scripts are 
provided. It should be possible to use other C++ compilers, but for that you 
will have to write the matching build script.
